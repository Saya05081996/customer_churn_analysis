## Project Information
This is a end-to-end data analysis project on Customer churn which describes and potrays the significant factors behind the customer churn. I have analysed several factors like age groups, credit card statuses, credit scores, product categoris and more. Power BI has been utilized to provide invaluable insights which helped in developing targeted strategies to reduce churn, such as personalized engagement for high-risk segments and improved customer service for younger demographics.
